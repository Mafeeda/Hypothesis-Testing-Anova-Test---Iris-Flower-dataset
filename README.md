# Hypothesis-Testing-Anova-Test---Iris-Flower-dataset


Anova ftest statistics: Analysis of varaince between more than 2 samples or columns.

Assume Null Hypothesis Ho as No Varaince: All samples population means are same. Thus Alternate Hypothesis Ha as It has Variance: Atleast one population mean is different.

As (p_value = 0) < (Î± = 0.05); Reject Null Hypothesis i.e. Atleast one population mean is different Thus there is variance in more than 2 samples.
